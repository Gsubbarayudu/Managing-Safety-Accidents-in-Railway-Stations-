# Managing-Safety-Accidents-in-Railway-Stations-
Trains as public transportation have been considered as safer than other means. However, passengers on trains stations sometimes face many risks because of many overlapping factors such as station operation, design, and passenger behaviours. 
The Algorithm used in this Project is :
K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm

The application of unsupervised machine learning for managing safety accidents in railway stations offers a promising avenue for enhancing safety and operational efficiency. By leveraging advanced algorithms, this approach enables the identification of potential safety hazards and unusual patterns without the need for extensive labeled datasets. This is particularly advantageous in dynamic and complex environments such as railway stations, where labeled data may be scarce or difficult to obtain.
