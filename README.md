# Managing-Safety-Accidents-in-Railway-Stations-
The project "Unsupervised Machine Learning for Managing Safety Accidents in Railway Stations" focuses on leveraging unsupervised learning techniques to enhance safety and accident management in railway stations. It aims to detect anomalous patterns and potential hazards by analyzing real-time surveillance data, passenger movement, and sensor inputs. By utilizing clustering and anomaly detection algorithms, the system can identify unusual activities that may indicate security threats, overcrowding, or operational malfunctions. The goal is to provide railway authorities with an automated, data-driven approach to improve incident response times, minimize risks, and ensure passenger safety. The project explores various machine learning models such as k-means clustering, DBSCAN, and autoencoders to effectively detect and classify safety incidents without relying on labeled datasets, making it suitable for dynamic and evolving railway environments. 
The Algorithm used in this Project is :
K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm

The application of unsupervised machine learning for managing safety accidents in railway stations offers a promising avenue for enhancing safety and operational efficiency. By leveraging advanced algorithms, this approach enables the identification of potential safety hazards and unusual patterns without the need for extensive labeled datasets. This is particularly advantageous in dynamic and complex environments such as railway stations, where labeled data may be scarce or difficult to obtain.
